# JSON Parser Benchmarks

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of JSON parsing performance across multiple language implementations.

## Benchmark Methodology

### Test Environment
- File Size: 17 MB JSON file
- Total Items: 100,000
- Metrics Tracked:
  - Execution Time
  - Memory Usage
  - CPU Utilization

### Benchmark Limitations and Recommendations
1. **Multiple Iterations**: Current benchmarks are based on single runs. For more statistically significant results, we recommend:
   - Running each benchmark at least 10 times
   - Calculating:
     - Mean execution time
     - Standard deviation
     - Median performance
   - Removing outliers

2. **Standardized Benchmarking**
   - Implement a consistent benchmarking framework
   - Use identical hardware and system conditions
   - Warm up the runtime before measuring
   - Clear system caches between runs

## Performance Results

### Node.js Implementation

## Performance Ranking
1. **Node.js**: Fastest execution, highest memory usage
2. **Rust**: Excellent performance, low memory footprint
3. **Go**: Moderate performance
4. **Python**: Slowest, but with promising optimized version

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Implement more diverse JSON parsing scenarios
2. Profile memory allocations and garbage collection
3. Analyze parallel processing effectiveness
4. Investigate optimization techniques for each implementation

## Conclusion
While these benchmarks provide valuable insights, performance can vary based on specific use cases and JSON structures. Always test with your specific workload.
